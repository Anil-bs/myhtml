            <p class="para">Idli or idly (/ɪdliː/ ( listen)) is a type of savoury rice cake, originating from South India, popular as a breakfast food in Southern India and in Sri Lanka. The cakes are made by steaming

            <p class="para">In its most simple form, dosa is crispy and crepe-like and is a very popular street food in India. Dosa is famous for its simple ingredients and savory, 
                slightly bitter flavor. It can be eaten as a snack, breakfast, or anytime you’re in the mood for a delicious, savory meal! </p>

            <p class="para">Pulao or pulav or pilaf, is comfort food at its best and I make it when I want to cook something quick, easy and satisfying. This one-pot dish made with fragrant 
                rice and colorful healthy vegetables has added spices and herbs, 
                giving it a mild fragrant flavor. This special veg pulao recipe is my mom’s and is my go-to recipe when making vegetable pulao.
                The dish is also vegetarian and is great on its own or paired with raita (an Indian yogurt dish),
                pickle and roasted papad (a crisp thin Indian snack).</p>

            <p class="para">Puri (sometimes spelled as poori) is a deep-fried bread made from unleavened whole-wheat flour that originated in the Indian subcontinent. 
                It is eaten for breakfast or as a snack or light meal. It is usually served with a savory curry or bhaji, as in puri bhaji, but may also be eaten with sweet dishes.

                Puris are most commonly served as breakfast and snacks. It is also served at special or ceremonial functions as part of ceremonial rituals along with other vegetarian 
                food offered in Hindu prayer as prasadam.</p>

                rice-based dish with origins in the state of Karnataka, India. It is said to have 
                originated in the Mysore Palace and it took 100 years for the dish to come out from the
                place and another 200 years to spread across the state of Karnataka.</p>
