        <p>A restaurant is a business that prepares and serves food and drinks to customers.
            Meals are generally served and eaten on the premises, but many restaurants also offer 
            take-out and food delivery services. Restaurants vary greatly in appearance and offerings, 
            including a wide variety of cuisines and service models ranging from inexpensive fast-food
            restaurants and cafeterias to mid-priced family restaurants, to high-priced luxury 
            establishments.</p>
        <h3>Restarunt Staff</h3>
        <p>A restaurant's proprietor is called a restaurateur, this derives from the French verb restaurer, 
            meaning "to restore". Professional cooks are called chefs, with there being various finer 
            distinctions (e.g. sous-chef, chef de partie). Most restaurants (other than fast food restaurants 
            and cafeterias) will have various waiting staff to serve food, beverages and alcoholic drinks, 
            including busboys who remove used dishes and cutlery. In finer restaurants, this may include a host
            or hostess, a maître d'hôtel to welcome customers and to seat them, and a sommelier or wine waiter
            to help patrons select wines. A new route to becoming a restaurateur, rather than working one's 
            way up through the stages, is to operate a food truck. Once a sufficient following has been 
            obtained, a permanent restaurant site can be opened. This trend has become common in the UK
            and the US.</p>
